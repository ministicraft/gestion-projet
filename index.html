                <p>En 2014, un film dénommé Prédestination est passé complètement inaperçu du grand public. En effet, n’étant pas sorti en salles, ce long-métrage des frères Spierig (Day breakers) n’a obtenu qu’une « simple sortie DVD »… Et pourtant, il peut clairement concurrencer avec une SF telle qu’Inception de Christopher Nolan et d’autres films tout aussi tordus à interpréter et comprendre. S’il ne paraît pas totalement incompréhensible, il semble pourtant perturbant. C’est pourquoi, tout au long de cet article, une explication d’un point de vue personnelle sera apportée afin d’essayer de mieux comprendre ce « chef d'oeuvre ».</p>
                <h4>Synopsis</h4>
                <p>Pour sauver son futur et en même temps sa carrière, un agent temporel remonte le temps afin de se rencontrer et se recruter dans le passé.</p>

                            <p>The mind reels at the thought of trying to review "Predestination." Not that it is bad,
                                mind you—in fact, it is really, really impressive and well worth venturing out to find
                                despite the crummy January weather (those in especially intemperate areas will be
                                relieved to find that it is on VOD as well)—but because this is one of those films that
                                is so filled with twists, turns and unexpected developments that even the most oblique
                                plot discussion threatens to wander into dreaded spoiler territory. Then again, I admit
                                that I knew pretty much everything that was going to happen going in thanks to my
                                familiarity with the source material, Robert Heinlein's celebrated 1959 short story
                                "—All You Zombies—," and still found myself knocked out by its startlingly effective
                                translation from the page to the screen. I will try to keep the details to a minimum,
                                but, trust me, the less you know going in, the better, especially considering the fact
                                that the story deals in no small part with time travel (and all of the attending
                                paradoxes) and that is not even close to being its most unusual aspect.</p>
                            <p>As it turns out, there are such things as Temporal Agents, an elite group of people
                                charged with traveling through time in order to prevent horrible crimes before they
                                occur. As the film opens, one such agent is trying to disarm the latest deadly explosive
                                set by the Fizzle Bomber, a terrorist wreaking havoc on Seventies-era New York when it
                                goes off in his face, burning him badly in the process. He manages to return to
                                headquarters and after massive plastic surgery and a long recuperation process, he
                                recovers and now looks like Ethan Hawke in the bargain. Returning to New York in the
                                hopes of catching the Fizzle Bomber, he is working as a bartender when he strikes up a
                                conversation with a slightly androgynous-looking guy who calls himself "The Unmarried
                                Mother"—he makes his living writing fake tales of woe for so-called "confession"
                                magazines—and who promises to tell "the best story that you ever heard," a saga that
                                begins in 1945 when she was left on the steps of an orphanage as an infant.</p>
                            <p>Yes, "she" for, as it turns out, he started life as a girl named Jane. Growing up in the
                                orphanage, Jane (eventually played as an adult by Sarah Snook) was relentlessly picked
                                on by her peers for being different but proved to be smart as a whip, surprisingly
                                strong and filled with determination. These qualities, not to mention the retention of
                                her virginity, prove to be of interest to SpaceCorp, a Sixties-era government agency
                                charged with recruiting women to go into space to provide relief, as it were, for
                                astronauts on long missions. Alas, after a fight, she is kicked out of SpaceCorp, but
                                one of the people in charge, the enigmatic Mr. Robertson (Noah Taylor), continues to
                                find her of interest. Around this time, though, Jane meets a mysterious man and falls in
                                love but is crushed when he vanishes, leaving her pregnant and alone. While delivering
                                her child, another unanticipated discovery is made that will change her life forever,
                                among other things. But I have already divulged far more than I probably should have,
                                even though I have not even come close to getting to the truly wild stuff yet.</p>
                            <p>So what can I talk about? For starters, there is the impressive job that the Australian
                                writing-directing team of brothers Peter and Michael Spierig have done in bringing
                                Heinlein's story, which he claimed to have written in a day, to life. Sticking fairly
                                close to the source material for the most part, they have figured out a way of
                                recounting it in a way that is straightforward enough for most attentive viewers to
                                follow and yet complex enough to inspire them to want to go back and watch it again.
                                (Here is where the VOD option might be helpful.) As for the time travel aspect,
                                "Predestination" follows the lead of some of the best films of its type (a short list
                                including the likes of "Time After Time," "Back to the Future II," "Primer" and
                                "Looper") by embracing the potential paradoxes rather than trying to ignore or explain
                                them away—the results are utterly preposterous, of course, but in a manner more
                                entertaining than annoying. (The only time the narrative steps wrong is towards the end,
                                mostly involving material invented solely for the film, and even then, these are flaws
                                born of ambition rather than laziness.) From a stylistic standpoint, it also impresses
                                in the way that it evokes the look and feel of the various eras that it touches on via
                                clever costumes, production design and cinematography rather than through lavish special
                                effects.</p>
                            <p>At the heart of "Predestination," however, are the two central performances by Ethan
                                Hawke and Sarah Snook that bring genuine emotional weight to a storyline that could have
                                easily plunged into utter nonsense. Hawke, for example, is an actor who in recent years
                                has more often than not been gravitating towards material that is off-beat and
                                original—at this point, his name on a marquee pretty much guarantees that the film in
                                question will at least be somewhat interesting. Even though he is more or less playing
                                the straight man this time around, he still clearly recognizes a juicy story when he
                                sees it (as he did with his previous collaboration with the Spierigs, the
                                better-than-average vampire saga "Daybreakers") and gives real life to a character that
                                could have easily blended into the woodwork in other hands.</p>
                            <p>As the heart of the story, however, Sarah Snook delivers a knockout performance that
                                calls on her to perform the kind of tricky scenes that could have resulted in bad laughs
                                throughout if handled incorrectly. Not only does she pull off her performance
                                brilliantly throughout—there is not one moment in which she is anything less that
                                utterly convincing and believable—I would go so far as to put her work here up against
                                any of the current front-runners for the Best Actress Oscar. If you have never heard of
                                her before, it probably means that you are one of the many who didn't see her in
                                "Jessabelle," a dopey horror movie that came and went last fall. In that film, she was
                                by far the best thing on display in a very bad movie. Here, she is the best thing on
                                display in a very good one. It's about time.</p>

                                <p>To try and wrap your head around the plot of Predestination can only lead to madness. Don't get me wrong: The movie itself is a trip. Just jump off the cliff and go with the Spierig brothers, Peter and Michael, as they whoosh into the labyrinth of their own fervid imaginations. If you get stuck and feel lost — and you will — don't sweat it. As writers and directors, the German-born, Aussie-bred brothers had a solid starting place for Predestination: Robert A. Heinlein's 1960 short story, All You Zombies.  Then they take it from there. Boy, do they ever.</p>
                                <p>Ethan Hawke, at his mesmerizing best, stars as the Temporal Agent, a time-traveler with a mission to stop future murders before they can happen. Before you can say Looper, the agent is tending bar in 1970's New York and chatting up a guy (Sarah Snook) who writes magazine stories under the byline "The Unmarried Mother." The Mother's backstory involves growing up in an orphanage in 1940's Cleveland. Stay with me. The Mother is really an intersex creature forced to transition into male form under bizarre circumstances that involve a 1960's government space experiment that...</p>
                                <p>Look, I could go on. Better that you just throw yourself into this tale and cogitate about it later. If getting stoned helps, so be it. One thing's for sure: You won't be able to take your eyes off Snook, an Aussie actress who makes whatever sex she's playing almost irrelevant. You watch her. You hear her. You believe. It's a dynamite performance. Hawke, who worked with the Spierigs on 2010's Daybreakers, gravitates to movies that don't play by the rules. Predestination sure as hell doesn't. Any frustration you feel about losing your bearings fades in face of the film's ultimate kick.</p>

                                <p>Like all time-travel stories, this inevitably trips on its own causal illogic – but not before it’s offered you a taste of something genuinely rich and strange, and probably toxic. It is based on a 1958 SF short story by Robert Heinlein and has touches of Philip K Dick. Ethan Hawke is working for a top-secret government unit that specialises in time travel. His job as a special agent is to zoom back in time to try and forestall a serial killer dubbed the “Fizzle Bomber” (due to the slow-action fuse of his explosive devices) at various stages of his long, notorious career. But while posing as a barman in 1970, Hawke comes across a mysterious trans character (Sarah Snook) with an extraordinary story to tell him. He figures this could be a vital recruit, and their destinies and histories are to be intertwined in headspinning ways. The counterfactual black humour is dizzying, and the movie is, to use Hawke’s own term, the snake that eats its own tail.</p>
